# Intention

Gitlab proposes to deploy the runner using Helm or GitLab operator. It requires additional
permissions. This approach problematically to use in OpenShift Container Platform if you don't have
cluster admin privileges. Moreover, default images are not designed to run using an arbitrarily
assigned user ID. This repo contains dockerfiles and an OpenShift template which allows you to
deploy the GitLab runner in OCP with minimum efforts.

In addition to the OpenShift related adoptions needed to run the Gitlab runner, we require some specific configuation before we can run it in Rahti/Rahti-int. Those additional configuations are included in this repo.

NOTE: This work has been mostly adopted from: https://github.com/RedHatQE/ocp-gitlab-runner.

## Usage

### Quick Rahti-int/Rahti Specifc Usage Instructions
1. Build and push the required images (Optional, otherwise a pre-built image will be used):
 ```sh
 docker build -t some_repo/some_image_name:some_tag -f runner.Dockerfile .
 docker push some_repo/some_image_name:some_tag

 docker build -t some_repo/some_other_image_name:some_tag -f helper.Dockerfile .
 docker push some_repo/some_other_image_name:some_tag
```

2. Deploy the runner by processing the template:
```sh
oc process -f rahti-gitlab-runner-template.yaml \
-p NAME="some-name" \
-p GITLAB_HOST="gitlab.ci.csc.fi" \
-p REGISTRATION_TOKEN="$(echo -n some_token | base64)" \
-p GITLAB_RUNNER_VERSION="v14.9.1" \
-p TLS_CA_CERT="$(openssl s_client -showcerts -connect gitlab.ci.csc.fi:443 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM | base64)" \
-p TEMPLATE_CONFIG_FILE="$(cat config.template.toml)" | oc create -f -
```

3. Clean up after usage
```sh
oc delete secret,cm,sa,rolebindings,bc,is,deployment -l app=some_name
```

## Contents

### runner.Dockerfile

This image based on `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-micro`. It contains `gitlab-runner`
executable that talks to GitLab CI and spawns builder pods via `kubernetes` executor.

### helper.Dockerfile

GitLab's helper image with `gitlab-runner-helper` executable. The image based on
`registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8-minimal`.

### ocp-gitlab-runner-template.yaml

An OpenShift template that creates required objects and deploys the runner with minimum efforts.
Just provide a name, GitLab instance host, runner's registration token and desired number of
concurrent build pods.
